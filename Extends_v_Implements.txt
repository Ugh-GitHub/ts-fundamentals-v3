Comparison Features	|	Extends		|	Implements

Implementation		|	The keyword extends is used when a class wants to inherit all the properties from another class or an interface that wants to inherit an interface.	|	We use the implements keyword when we want a class to implement an interface.


Associated with		|	It is associated with Inheritance	|	It is associated with Abstraction


Method			|	The child class that extends a parent class may or may not override all the methods present in the parent class.		|	The class that implements an interface must define or provide the implementation of all the methods declared in the interface, or else the class should be declared as abstract.


Class			|	A subclass or more than one subclass can extend only one parent class at the same time.	|	A class can implement one or more than one interface at the same time.


Interface		|	An interface can extend any number of interfaces.	|	An interface can never implement any other interface.
