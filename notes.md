## Chapter 1

##### tsconfig

` {
  "compilerOptions": {
    "outDir": "dist", // where to put the TS files
    "target": "ES3" // which level of JS support to target
  },
  "include": ["src"] // which files to compile
} `

##### ts files

A good way to think of TS files:

.ts files (source files) contain both type information and code that runs
.js files (compiled code) contain only code that runs
.d.ts files (declaration files) contain only type information

## Chapter 2

type inference: places where typescript infers type where no type info was provided (i.e. in `let age = 6;` `age: number`, whereas `const apples = 6` will be `apples: 6` [a literal type]). [See the link for more specific info](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/type-inference.html).

const: const variable declarations cannot be reassigned. They are immutable value types, also known as literal types (in the apples example, the const can only hold 6).

any: most flexible type. Typescript can infer from a simple declaration of a unassigned variable (i.e. `let endTime`).

type annotation: example `let endTime: Date`

function args and return values: 
```
function add(a: number <!-- argument value -->, b: number): number <!-- return  value -->  {
  return a + b;
}
```

## Chapter 3

In general, object types are defined by:
1. The names of the properties that are (or may be) present
2. The types of those properties

```
let car: {
  make: string
  model: string
  year: number
}
```

NOTE: doesn't appear to be a way to assign values in the declaration.


optional property: use a `?` operator after the property name. ex: `chargeVoltage?: number`

Typescript also handles excess properties. If the error comes up, check the last part of the error message.

```
function printCar(car: {
  make: string
  model: string
  year: number
  chargeVoltage?: number
}) {
  // implementation removed for simplicity
}
 
printCar({
  make: "Tesla",
  model: "Model 3",
  year: 2020,
  chargeVoltage: 220,
  color: "RED", // <0------ EXTRA PROPERTY
```

This can be resolved by:
1. Remove the color property from the object
2. Add a color: string to the function argument type
3. Create a variable to hold this value, and then pass the variable into the printCar function

##### Index signatures

Useful when trying to represent dictionaries. The index signature is a way to represent the value assigned to a key in the dictionary object. It's a great when all of the names of the type's properties aren't known ahead of time, but the shape of the values is known. The index signature must be a number, string, (symbol)[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol], or a (template literal type)[https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/template-literal-types.html].


```
const phones = {
  home: { country: "+1", area: "211", number: "652-4515" },
  work: { country: "+1", area: "670", number: "752-5856" },
  fax: { country: "+1", area: "322", number: "525-4357" },
}

const phones: {
  [k: string]: {
    country: string
    area: string
    number: string
  }
} = {}
 
phones.fax
```

##### Array Types

Describing types for arrays is often as easy as adding [] to the end of the array memberâ€™s type. For example, `const fileExtensions = ['js', 'ts']` will have a type of `string[]`.

##### Tuples
